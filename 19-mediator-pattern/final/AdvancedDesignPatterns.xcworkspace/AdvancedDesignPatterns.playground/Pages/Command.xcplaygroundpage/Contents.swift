 The command pattern is a behavioral pattern that encapsulates information to perform an action into a "command object." It involves three types:
 
 1. The **invoker** stores and executes commands.
 2. The **command** encapsulates the action as an object.
 3. The **receiver** is the object that's acted upon by the command.
