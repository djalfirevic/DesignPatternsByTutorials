 The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern separates objects into three types: models, views and controllers.
 
 **Models** hold onto application data. They are usually structs or simple classes.
 
 **Views** display visual elements and controls on screen. They are usually subclasses of `UIView`.
 
 **Controllers** coordinate between models and views. They are usually subclasses of `UIViewController`.
