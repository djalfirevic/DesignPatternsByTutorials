 The memento pattern allows an object to be saved and restored. It involves three parts:
 
 (1) The **originator** is the object to be saved or restored.
 
 (2) The **memento** is a stored state.
 
 (3) The **caretaker** requests a save from the originator, and it receives a memento in response. The care taker is responsible for persisting the memento, so later on, the care taker can provide the memento back to the originator to request the originator restore its state.
