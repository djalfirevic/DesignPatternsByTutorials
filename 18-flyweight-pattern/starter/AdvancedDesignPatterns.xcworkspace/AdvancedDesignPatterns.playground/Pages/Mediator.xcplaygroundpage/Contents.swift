 The mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates how objects communicate with one another. It involves four types:
 
 1. The **colleagues** are the objects that want to communicate with each other. They implement the colleague protocol.
 
 2. The **colleague protocol** defines methods and properties that each colleague must implement.
 
 3. The **mediator** is the object that controls the communication of the colleagues. It implements the mediator protocol.
 
 4. The **mediator protocol** defines methods and properties that the mediator must implement.
