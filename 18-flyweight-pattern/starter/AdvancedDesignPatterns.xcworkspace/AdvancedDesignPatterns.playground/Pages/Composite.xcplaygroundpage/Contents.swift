 The composite pattern is a structural pattern that groups a set of objects into a tree so that they may be manipulated as though they were one object. It uses three types:
 
 1. The **component protocol** ensures all constructs in the tree can be treated the same way.
 2. A **leaf** is a component of the tree that does not have child elements.
 3. A **composite** is a container that can hold leaf objects and composites.
